- Install a tab bar view controller as the root view controller of your app
- The first view content view controller of your tab bar should be your map view controller with the following functionality:
	- A map view that takes up the entire view of the view controller
	- On long press it should place a pin on the map
	- Pressing on the pin should show a callout with the title of the annotation and a button
	- Pressing the button should segue to a screen that allows the user to add a region to monitor, based on where they long pressed on the map view.
